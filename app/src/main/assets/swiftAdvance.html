        Classes and structures are general-purpose, flexible constructs that become the building blocks of your programâ€™s code. You define properties and methods to add functionality to your classes and structures by using exactly the same syntax as for constants, variables, and functions.

        Unlike other programming languages, Swift does not require you to create separate interface and implementation files for custom classes and structures. In Swift, you define a class or a structure in a single file, and the external interface to that class or structure is automatically made available for other code to use.

        An instance of a class is traditionally known as an object. However, Swift classes and structures are much closer in functionality than in other languages, and much of this chapter describes functionality that can apply to instances of either a class or a structure type. Because of this, the more general term instance is used.
